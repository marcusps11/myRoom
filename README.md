# myRoom
Front end developer project

I decided to stick to the wireframes and then once I had it all working play around with it but unfortunately did not have time.  
I plan on changing all the CSS to sass to help me practice working with it.

I used bootstrap 3 as I find the grid system a great way of organising my layouts and keeping the page responsive.

I tried to write my JS object orientated. I am interested to see whether the way I went around it was a good way of doing it or a bit longwinded for a simple task.  I was initally going to do it using ajax requests but thought it may have been a bit longwinded creating a database etc for relatively simple task.

I had fun making this - obviously there are things that are as not as slick as I would like but Im still learning!
