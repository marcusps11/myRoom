Front end developer project

I decided to stick to the wire frames and then once I had it all working play around with it but unfortunately did not have time.
I plan on changing all the CSS to sass to help me practice working with it.

I used bootstrap 3 as I find the grid system a great way of organising my layouts and keeping the page responsive.

I tried to write my JS object orientated. I am interested to see whether the way I went around it was a good way of doing it or a bit long winded for a simple task. I was initially going to do it using Ajax requests but thought it may have been a bit long winded creating a database etc for relatively simple task.

I had fun making this - obviously there are things that are as not as slick as I would like but I'm still learning!

Tech used HTML/CSS/JS Bootstrap 3
